GRIMALDI'S FUNERAL ORA TION. 11

and number of blessed souls He may place the man wh0,
during his years, pressed earth (as Homer says), not as a
useless heap of clay‚* but, his tale of life well told out,
he lest to posterity an honourable memorial of himself,
wh0, with such great humanity, wisd0m‚ and piety, has .
finished the course of life by nature circumscribed to men,
and who, lastly, with earnestness so great, has ever observed
all things which pertain to the most excellent Christian.

lle Oration os Alexander Grimaldi, of Antipolis, sor
Alciatz‘.

Tell me, Ι pray‚ what inferior man the tomb conceals,
Or whether the great and renowned Andrea Alciati?
It possesses of all men, in truth, the noblest‚
' And to speak simply, by Jove! the most illustrious.
Earth hides the body, which also here is laid3
But of Alciati indeed immortal is the glory.

THE erint

HnnTHrmLD, Knursrottn,
suly 27tlt, 1871.

* “ ἐτώσιον ἄχθος ἀρούρης.”

† “ Τοῦ Ἀλεξάνδρου Γριμάλόον ὰντιπολιτάνου εἰς Ἀλκίοτον.”

Grimaldi’s Greek stanza, besides certain inaccuracies is so illegibly printed
that the text itself is uncertain. It is subjoined, with some slight corrections.

Εἰπέ μοι δέομαι κ’ ὀλίγον τινὰ καλύπτει,
ἣ μέγαν ἀνδρείαν τ ἔξοχον Ἀλκίοτον;
χεῖνον ἔχει ἀνδρῶν δήπου κάλλιστον ἁπάντων
ὥστ’ ἀλλῶς εἰπεῖν νὴ Δία κλεινότατον ,
σῶμα δὲ γῆ κρύπτει, τῆνον rai ἐνθάδε κεῖται,
ἀλλὰ μὲν Ἀλκιὰτον ἄμὲροτόν ἐστι κλέος.
τέλος.
