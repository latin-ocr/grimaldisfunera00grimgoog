GRIMALDI'S FUNERAL ΘΚΑ ΤΙΟΝ. 9

grief! Death made ready, set before us, defined, is in like
manner common to all, as a true debt of nature :—

“ We owe to death ourselves and ours ;
Nor does it spare beauty, nobes, or imperial powers.''

For-

“Pale death with equal foot beats at poor men's cottages
And at the towers os kings.”

If, indeed, according to the truest sentiment of philo-
sophers, we wish to examine this whole matter a little
deeper, we shall very readily judge that life, and not
death, is true. For (as it is in Euripides)—

“ Who knows not that to live is but to die 2*
And that by mortals, to die is deemed to live ?''

For, from a certain wise man we have heard that we are
now dead, and that sor us the body is our sepulchre; and
that then we truly live, when we are liberated srom this
dark prison oi earth and emigrate to the 'citadel of heaven.
Now, in what way can this be named life, which, like a
most stormy sea, is daily tossed by tempests and waves?
The ancient Fathers, thinking excellently of this very
thing, have compared such a life to a ganne oi dice.
Nor, undeservedly, has Euripides named it “one little
day;’' Phalereus Demetrius, “a point of time ;’' but, best
of all, Pindar, “the dream of a shad0w3²

Now at length therefore lives—lives the divine Alciati,
and instead of this mortal condition, he has obtained
immortality of life, and that glory which can scarcely be
bounded by heaven itself. He has leit behind the very
firmest saseguards os virtue, which alone, when all other
things are lost, can· (as M. Tully testifies) support them-
selves. For in the state of mortals there is no stability,
no constancy so great, as in those things which are ad-
ministered by virtue. And virtue is wont to beat back ·
the cruelty of death, and (as it is said) is fastened by the
deepest rootS, which by no force can ever be overthrown,

Τὸ κατθανεῖν δὲ ζῆν νομίζεται βροτοῖς.”
