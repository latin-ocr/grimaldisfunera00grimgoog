within the first threshold os his youth he composed
EmblemS, EpigramS, ElegieS, ComedieS, and divers other
poemS, so gay, so pleasing, so elegant, that nothing could

copious, should be no longer spent on these subjects, nor
should his divine memory ol things and words be employed
upon them, in which he much surpassed Cyrus, Mithri-
dateS, and Charmides; but from these pursuitS, which
are worthy of a liberal-minded man, he turned aside.
